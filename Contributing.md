**Getting Started**

Before you begin, please ensure you are familiar with the following:

Codebase Overview: We expect contributors to have reviewed the relevant parts of the codebase. Documentation is available in the README.md file.
Project Scope: Make sure you fully understand the requirements of the feature you are developing. Feature details, user stories, and requirements are provided in the issue tracker or project board.

**Prerequisites**

To contribute, ensure you have the following installed:

[Language/Framework name] (version X.X.X)
[Package Manager] (version X.X.X)
Git
[Additional tools, libraries, or SDKs required]

**Workflow**

We follow a structured development workflow to maintain the quality and stability of our production environment.

1. Fork and Clone the Repository

Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

Clone your fork locally

2. Create a Feature Branch
   
All feature work must be done in a separate branch. Name the branch descriptively, following this pattern: feature/[short-description].

3. **Coding Standards**
   
Follow the coding standards outlined below:

Code Style: We adhere to [style guide (e.g., PEP 8, ESLint)] for consistent code formatting.

Commit Messages: Use clear and concise commit messages. Follow this format:

[feature/fix][module-name]: description of change

Example: [feature] Added filtering for health facility locator

Tests: Ensure any code submitted is covered by unit or integration tests. Place tests in the tests/ directory.

Comments: Write clear and meaningful comments where necessary, especially for complex logic.

4. Push and Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Once your feature is ready and you've tested your changes:

Push your branch to GitHub

It should include:

A brief description of the feature.
Relevant issue/feature ID.
List of any dependencies (libraries, APIs, etc.).
Any known issues, limitations, or further considerations.

5. Review Process

All PRs will be reviewed by our internal team. The review will focus on:

Code Quality: Clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

Functionality: The feature works as specified without breaking existing functionality.

Security: No vulnerabilities or security risks are introduced.

After review, you may be asked to make revisions. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the development branch and later deployed to production after thorough testing.

**Branching Strategy**

We use a branching strategy to manage development and production releases:

main: The production branch containing stable, released code.

Development: The branch for ongoing feature development. All features are merged here before production release.

feature/[short-description]: Each feature is developed in a separate branch and merged into development upon completion.
Issue Tracking and Communication

Feature Requests and Bugs: All tasks and issues are tracked in the GitHub issue tracker. Please check it regularly for assigned tasks or feature updates.

Communication: Use [Slack, Email, or preferred communication tool] to discuss feature details, updates, or blockers. We expect regular updates on the taskâ€™s progress.

Testing and Debugging

Unit Testing: All new features should have unit tests that verify functionality. Use [testing framework] to write and run tests.
Integration Testing: Ensure your feature integrates well with the rest of the app. This may involve end-to-end testing where needed.

Bug Reporting: If you encounter bugs while working, please report them in the issue tracker with steps to reproduce and any relevant logs or screenshots.

**Deployment Process**

We manage deployments internally. After merging your code into development and testing it thoroughly, the internal team will handle deployment to production.
